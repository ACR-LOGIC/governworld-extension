# GovernWorld Redaction — Chrome Web Store Readiness

Status of the store-submission materials for the local-first redaction
extension. All user-facing copy uses **synthetic examples only**; no real
PII/PHI appears in screenshots, listing copy, or disclosures.

**Copyright (c) 2026 Andres Chavez Ramirez. All rights reserved.**

## Listing materials

- **Name:** GovernWorld Redaction
- **Summary:** Detect and redact sensitive values (PII/PHI) on the page you
  are viewing and in the documents you open — locally, on your device.
- **Full description:** See `STORE_DESCRIPTION.md`.
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Primary language:** English
- **Privacy policy URL:** packaged as `PRIVACY.md`; must be hosted at a
  public URL (repo `docs/extensions/` path or company site) before store
  submission.
- **Single purpose:** Find and redact sensitive values in content the user
  explicitly chooses to scan. The extension has one purpose and does not
  change behavior based on the site visited.
- **Permission justification:** `PERMISSIONS.md` (also mirrors the manifest).

## Required disclosures (must appear in listing + settings)

1. The extension scans only after an explicit user action (button press).
2. All processing is local by default; no content leaves the device unless
   cloud analysis is enabled (disabled by default, and no cloud feature ships
   in this version).
3. In-page masks are temporary overlays that do not change the source website.
4. Document redaction downloads a new flattened file; the original is never
   modified or uploaded.
5. The extension stores no raw content and requests no `*://*` host
   permissions.
6. Using the extension does not by itself make a user or organization HIPAA
   compliant.

## Settings screen links

The popup settings section includes:

- **Privacy policy** link → packaged `PRIVACY.md` (opens via
  `chrome.runtime.getURL`); must also be hosted at the canonical public URL
  before submission.
- **Support** link → `https://github.com/ACR-LOGIC/governworld-extension/issues`
- **Export audit log** → signed, metadata-only audit export.

The links are implemented in `src/popup/index.html`; only the canonical
hosted URL remains external (see checklist).

## Screenshots (to capture before submission)

Capture on a **local fixture page** with synthetic data only (the spec's
fixture page, `scripts/make-fixture.mjs` output, or the corpus generator).
Never capture real customer content.

1. Popup closed / extension icon state (1280px or common laptop resolution).
2. Popup open showing the disclosure, mode picker (Local only selected), and
   "Scan this page" button.
3. Findings list with **masked** previews (e.g. `phone: ***-***-1234`), Apply
   masks / Remove masks / Copy redacted text controls.
4. A page with overlay masks applied, showing the footnote that masks are
   temporary.
5. Document review step: a synthetic PDF with detected boxes and the
   "Redact selected & download" button.
6. Download confirmation dialog for the flattened copy.

Requirements for each: no real PII/PHI, no addresses, no URLs with query
parameters visible, no browser chrome identifying real user data, English
text, at least 640x400, PNG or JPEG.

## Store submission checklist

- [x] Manifest is MV3 with least-privilege permissions (`activeTab`,
      `scripting`, `storage`, `downloads`, `offscreen`, `sidePanel`,
      `contextMenus`; no `<all_urls>`, no `tabs`). Every declared permission
      is justified in `PERMISSIONS.md` and named in `STORE_DESCRIPTION.md`.
- [x] Single-purpose description aligned with actual behavior.
- [x] Privacy policy drafted (`PRIVACY.md`), versioned v1.0.0 with support
      contact; pending publication at the canonical URL after push.
- [x] Permission justification drafted (`PERMISSIONS.md`).
- [x] Listing description finalized in `STORE_DESCRIPTION.md` to match the
      enforced local-only behavior and current permissions.
- [x] All fixture/test content synthetic.
- [x] Release packaging tooling: `npm run release:zip` builds from the
      reviewed commit (refuses un-reviewed HEAD) and emits
      `release/governworld-redaction-<commit>.zip` for store submission.
- [x] Manifest description within the 132-character store limit (shortened
      2026-08-21); extension icons (16/32/48/128) added to the manifest and
      packaged in `dist/icons/`.
- [x] Accessibility-surface scan shipped report-only (`source:"attr"`,
      `aria-label`/`alt`/`placeholder`/`title`, DOM never mutated, no raw
      attribute values stored) — disclosed in PRIVACY.md and listing copy.
- [x] Privacy policy published at
      `https://governworld.acrlogic.com/chrome-extension-privacy` (the
      extension's own notice — not the website policy at `/privacy`) and linked
      from the popup's settings section, `landing.html`, and the listing.
- [x] Screenshots captured from a local synthetic fixture page in
      `release/screenshots/`, via `npm run capture:store`. The store requires at
      least one **1280x800** image and accepts at most 5; the script reads each
      PNG's IHDR and fails unless every image is exactly 1280x800. The UI
      walkthrough cannot produce these (it shoots `fullPage` at a 1280x900
      viewport, so any overflowing surface captures at 1265px wide).
- [x] Small promo tile (**440x280**, required; only the 1400x560 marquee tile is
      optional) at `release/images/promo-tile-440x280.png`, via
      `npm run capture:promo`. Brand tokens are read from `src/popup/popup.css`
      so the tile cannot drift from the product's colours.
- [x] Store icon is 128x128 (`icons/icon-128.png`), already declared in the
      manifest.
- [x] Packaged artifact verified independently of `dist/`:
      `npm run verify:zip <zip>` extracts the release ZIP and loads it in
      Chromium, asserting the manifest sits at the archive root, every manifest
      reference and offline asset is present, both legal pages are packaged and
      linked, and all five pages load CSP-clean.
- [x] Final review that no real PII/PHI appears in any listing asset
      (synthetic fixtures + secret scan; see `RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md`).
- [x] Security review sign-off before submission (APPROVED by the principal, 2026-09-29,
      2026-08-22; recorded in `RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md`).
- [x] Commit approved, then generate the release zip from the exact reviewed
      commit and record artifact SHA-256 in `RELEASE_EVIDENCE.md`.
      (that commit no longer exists after the 2026-09-29 history rewrite, and the archive was never retained)
- [x] Side panel added (`sidePanel` permission, `Alt+Shift+P`) as a persistent
      scanning/document/account surface.
- [x] Notifications shipped as an **optional** permission (`notifications`),
      requested at runtime only when the user enables the toggle.
- [x] Optional-permission UX: no new permission is required at install.
- [x] Account linking (gateway origin + `gw_` API key) is fail-closed and
      reuses the existing tenant — no onboarding/tenant-provisioning in the
      extension; profile + extension add-on purchase ride the existing
      Stripe checkout/webhook/entitlement plane.
- [x] Developer preset added — API keys & secrets category (OpenAI, Anthropic,
      Google, Stripe, GitHub, Slack, SendGrid, npm, Twilio, Databricks, AWS,
      Azure, private keys, JWTs, connection strings, credential assignments)
      selectable via the Developer preset or Custom.
- [x] Preset behavior: Custom = all checkboxes; HIPAA/PCI/GDPR/Developer
      auto-select their covered categories; unchecking any box reverts the
      preset to Custom.
- [x] Preset transitions are recorded in the signed audit log
      (`preset_applied` / `preset_overridden` with the active category set) so
      reviewers can trace why a category was not redacted.
- [x] One-time "Please verify your work" accuracy notice (pattern-based
      detection is not guaranteed complete) shown after the first scan.
- [x] Instructions section in the side panel (page scanning, keyboard
      shortcuts, side panel, document redaction, accuracy).
- [x] Landing page (`landing.html`, also served at localhost preview root)
      with Overview, Security, Privacy, About Us, and About This Extension
      tabs.
- [x] Optional redaction labels (`maskPlaceholders`): when enabled, applied
      mask blocks show a short white label (e.g. `[SSN]`, `[DOB]`,
      `[API KEY]`) identifying what was covered. Off by default.
- [x] **Release ZIP generated & verified** from reviewed commit `2597aec` (`release/governworld-redaction-2597aec.zip`, SHA-256 `9CB7F4CF22FA8F1E5F11EE4EC9CB4D59D526C9D223A215A958F8C7BAA602989B`). Verified via `node scripts/verify-release-zip.mjs release/governworld-redaction-2597aec.zip --check-only` (manifest at zip root, all 11 manifest references, offline WASM/tessdata assets, and legal pages present).

## Deployment note (gateway adapter, spec step 8)

Step 8 (optional cloud/gateway analysis) is **not implemented** because no
gateway deployment mode exists for the extension — the spec's request
contract is a proposal and no server endpoint implements it. Shipping a live
adapter against a nonexistent backend would be speculative. Consequently the
**Cloud analysis** radio in the popup is disabled, and the service worker
rejects any `POPUP_SET_MODE`/scan attempt with `mode: "cloud"` (fail closed,
deny-by-default) until a gateway is deployed, authenticated, auditable, and
has a defined privacy/compliance posture. The store listing must not claim
cloud analysis exists.

The side-panel **account linking** surface is a distinct, opt-in feature: it
only stores a user-pasted gateway origin + API key for profile display and
Stripe checkout of the extension add-on. It never sends scan content and does
not enable cloud analysis.
