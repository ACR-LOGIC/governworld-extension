// Windows is misleading. Git checks out text files with CRLF when
// core.autocrlf is set, so `Get-FileHash package-lock.json` on a Windows
// checkout produces a different digest from the committed content. That is a
// real trap - it looks like the release evidence is wrong when it is not.
//
// The committed blob is the canonical artifact, so that is what is checked
// here. Run it before trusting any digest in the evidence file.
