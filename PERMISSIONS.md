# GovernWorld Redaction — Permission Justification

Chrome Web Store reviewers ask why an extension needs each permission. This
document maps every permission in `manifest.json` to the exact feature that
uses it, and lists permissions the extension deliberately does **not** request.

## Requested permissions

| Permission   | Why it is needed | Used by |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| `activeTab`  | Grants one-time access to the current tab **only** after the user presses "Scan this page". The extension never gains background access to all tabs and never scans without user action. | `src/service-worker/index.ts` (injection orchestration) |
| `scripting`  | Injects the content script that extracts visible text and renders overlay masks into the active tab, only after the `activeTab` grant. | `src/service-worker/index.ts` |
| `storage`    | Persists user preferences (detection categories, mode) in `chrome.storage.local` and ephemeral scan session state in `chrome.storage.session`. Never stores raw content. | `src/shared/settings.ts`, `src/service-worker/index.ts` |
| `downloads`  | Saves the flattened redacted copy the user explicitly creates, with the browser's save dialog (`saveAs: true`). The original file is never touched. | `src/service-worker/documents.ts` |
| `offscreen`  | Runs document rendering (pdf.js) and OCR (tesseract.js) in a dedicated offscreen document, because MV3 service workers have no DOM or `Worker` API. | `src/offscreen/offscreen.ts` |
| `sidePanel`  | Shows the GovernWorld side panel, a persistent surface for scanning, findings review, document redaction, notifications, and account/extension-license management. It opens via the popup's "Open side panel" button and the `Alt+Shift+P` command. | `manifest.json` (`side_panel`, `commands`), `src/service-worker/index.ts` (`chrome.sidePanel.open`), `src/popup/popup.ts` |
| `contextMenus` | Adds three entries to the browser context menu — "Scan page for sensitive data", "Redact selection to clipboard", and "Mask selected text" — so the same on-demand actions can be started from a right-click. The entries are created only while the user has the setting enabled and are removed when it is disabled. It grants no access to page content by itself: each entry still runs the existing user-initiated scan path and still depends on an explicit click. | `src/service-worker/index.ts` (`syncContextMenus`, `chrome.contextMenus.onClicked`), `src/shared/settings.ts` (`contextMenusEnabled`) |

## Optional permissions (requested at runtime, never at install)

| Permission      | Why it is requested | When |
|-----------------|---------------------|------|
| `notifications` | Raises a system notification when a scan finds sensitive data — only if the user enables the "Notify me" toggle. Denied requests simply stay off; no functionality depends on it. | Side panel → Notifications toggle |
| `http://*/*`, `https://*/*` (optional host access) | Lets the always-on paste-protection mode guard pages on every site the user visits. Requested only when the user switches always-on on; denied or revoked access leaves the default this-tab mode fully working. The registration is removed when always-on is off, so revoking genuinely stops coverage. | Protection settings → Always-on toggle |

## Declared `host_permissions`

**None at install.** The extension declares **zero install-time host permissions** and **zero automatic site-access permissions**. Default installs operate entirely on-device with zero automatic access to any website. Optional http(s) site access exists solely for the user-approved always-on mode (see above).

## Permissions the extension deliberately does NOT request

| Permission     | Why it is avoided |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Automatic (install-time) host permissions / `<all_urls>` | No background or automatic access to web traffic or sites. Page access for always-on is optional, runtime-granted http(s) only, and revocable. |
| `tabs`         | Unnecessary; `activeTab` covers the one user-chosen tab without requesting browsing history. |
| `webRequest`   | The extension must not observe or modify network traffic. |
| `clipboardRead`| Clipboard writes use the standard `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with no read permission. |
| `history` / `bookmarks` | No feature touches browsing history or bookmarks. |
| `cookies`      | No cookies are read or written. |
| `notifications`| Requested only as an optional permission (see above) — never required at install. |

## Data handling

- No raw scanned text or page snapshots are persisted to storage, logs, telemetry, analytics, or error reporting.
- Scan session state lives in `chrome.storage.session` (cleared on browser restart) and holds findings metadata with masked previews only.
- File bytes for the document you open are staged in the extension's private IndexedDB only while you review or redact the file. Clear-data, document-clear, completed redaction, browser startup, and extension install/update remove staged files. A service-worker restart does **not**: MV3 workers are suspended when idle and restarted on the next event, so purging on every restart would delete a document the user was still reviewing.
- No scan content or raw sensitive data is transmitted to the cloud. All detection, OCR, and redaction execute locally on your machine, and the document pipeline has no network path at all.
