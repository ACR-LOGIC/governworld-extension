## 💛 100% Free, Local-First & Community Supported

GovernWorld is built on an uncompromising commitment to privacy:
* **Local processing by default:** All scanning, OCR, pattern matching, and document flattening happen on your local device, and protected content never leaves it during local scanning and redaction.
* **Zero Data Monetization:** We never sell, track, monetize, or transmit user data or document contents.
* **Completely Free:** Every core protection capability is free for everyone.

### Sponsoring Development
If GovernWorld helps protect your privacy or workflow, you can support ongoing maintenance, offline OCR models, and validator improvements by sponsoring via Buy Me a Coffee:

## Architecture & Privacy Invariants

- **Local-First Invariant:** No feature may send raw page text, document bytes, or unmasked sensitive values across the network. All detection and redaction must execute on-device.
- **Zero Host Permissions:** Do not add broad host permissions (`*://*` or domain-specific wildcards). All tab interactions must occur through explicit user action (`activeTab`).
- **Fail-Closed Audit:** Any operation affecting redaction policies or document outputs must generate an immutable, ECDSA-signed audit record.
- **Clean Code & Testing:** Every new detection pattern or feature must include unit tests under `tests/` and maintain 100% test pass rates.
