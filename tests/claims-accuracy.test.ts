// Guards against re-introducing claims the implementation does not support.
//
// An adversarial review of this extension found that several statements
// outran what the code does. Each is technically defensible, and each would
// mislead a security reviewer who checks:
//
//   - "100% local"            the extension does talk to a community service and
//                              an API layer; only local scanning is local.
//   - "proactive" paste guard  with no host permissions and no declarative
//                              content scripts, the guard is absent from any tab
//                              the user has not activated.
//   - "tamper-evident" audit  a signature proves an export is unaltered, not
//                              that the log is a complete history.
//   - six OCR languages       only English traineddata was ever vendored.
//
// This asserts the corrected wording is present, so a later edit that restores the
// stronger claim fails here rather than in a review.
