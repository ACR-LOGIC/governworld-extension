// The document pipeline is the one part of this extension that must have no
// network path: it is handed raw document bytes and image pixels, and a remote
// fetch from inside it would mean protected content could reach a third party
// by a route nobody audits.
//
// tesseract.js makes that easy to get wrong by accident. Its defaults are
// remote: `workerPath` defaults to a jsDelivr URL, and inside the worker
// `langPath` defaults to a jsDelivr URL for @tesseract.js-data. We override all
// three. This file exists because "we override them" is a comment, and a
// comment does not fail when someone deletes a line.
//
// These assertions are deliberately about the *shape* of the configuration
// rather than about the contents of dist/, because dist/ is gitignored and
// absent in a clean checkout. The build-time pairing between the configured
// filenames and the files actually copied is covered separately by
// tests/dist-manifest.test.ts and tests/ocr-bundled-languages.test.ts.
