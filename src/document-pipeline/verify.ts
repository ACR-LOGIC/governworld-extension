// Producing bytes is not the same as redacting. A painter can silently no-op, a

// receives a file that still shows the sensitive value while the UI reports
// success. That is precisely the kind of claim the audit chain exists to make
// trustworthy, so "we produced a file" and "we checked the file" are tracked as
// separate states.

// Runs inside the offscreen document: it needs DOM canvas access.
