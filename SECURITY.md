# Security Policy — GovernWorld Chrome Extension

## Security Architecture & Guarantees

The GovernWorld Chrome Extension is designed with a **strict local-first, zero-telemetry security model**:

1. **On-Device Processing:** All detection, regular expression evaluation, identifier validation (SSN, Luhn, DEA, MBI, NPI, ISO 7064 Mod-97 IBAN, ICAO Doc 9303 MRZ, Passports), OCR extraction, and document flattening occur entirely on the user's local device.
2. **Zero Network Transmission:** The extension transmits zero scanned page content, zero raw sensitive findings, and zero document bytes over any network interface.
3. **No Automatic Host Access:** The extension requests zero `host_permissions`. It interacts only with the active tab upon explicit user gesture via `activeTab` and `scripting`.
4. **Transient Storage Lifecycle:** Document bytes are held in private local storage solely during active editing/redaction and are automatically purged upon download completion, user clearance, or service worker startup.
5. **Cryptographic Audit Trail & Compliance Attestation:** Audit logging records metadata-only, ECDSA P-256 signed event chains. Standalone, printable Verifiable Compliance Certificates (`governworld-compliance-certificate-*.html`) attest to zero-egress local processing and key authenticity without exposing raw sensitive values.
6. **No Remote Code Execution:** The extension strictly enforces Manifest V3 Content Security Policy (`script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'`). No remote scripts, `eval()`, or dynamic code injection from untrusted sources are permitted.
7. **Rule Import & ReDoS Defense:** Imported user logic rules undergo rigorous client-side schema parsing and ReDoS execution safety analysis (`isSafeRegex`) to eliminate denial-of-service risks prior to local storage.
